## E﻿arly exposure to programming

M﻿y early days of being able to touch the C language is around 2006 on my 2nd year in college where we have a subject known as *Computer 1*. I remember only one program I have written in C at that time which is the conversion of an integer number to Roman Numerals. It was satisfying. That was my first program in any language and for the first time, the computer did what I intend it to do.

T﻿hese were the days when most used in this time of learning C was Turbo-C. This was the only IDE back then that was introduced to us. It was not even explained that it was called IDE. And that was the exposure I had with C in college, a one semester of one computer subject.

## Hindrance to C

T﻿he next language that was introduced to us was C++. And the experience were the same, not quite comprehensive and just basic stuff. Then fast forward to third year, somewhere in 2007, where the language visual basic 6.0 was introduced. Well that was obviously easier to comprehend with if you look at it right now. Because the controls you have to do are just drag and drop away. All you left to code is the logic of the program.

B﻿eing the only familiar language to me at the time, VB6 is what I used even on my thesis project where I wrote a software for structural analysis of various materials. That was not the last time I used VB6. I also used it more than a year later in a job to write material estimates software.

I﻿n 2010 to 2011, I tried web development with PHP. At this time, I haven't gotten much into a real world problem solving software but just the basics. I tried to create a social networking site but didn't got much traction. This was not the first time I tried web development, the first experience I had was back in college around 2007-2008 where wapsites (Wireless Application Protocol) are popular. I created a wapsite back then using the wapsite creator `wen.ru`.

D﻿uring this time on 2011, I tried learning and going back to C with modern tools. No Turbo-C anymore but with modern IDEs. However, the thing that struck me the most is when I come to the topic of pointers. I seem to have a hard time grasping the concept. This is my biggest reason to stop learning C and pivot to easier to learn languages. 

A﻿nd so I tried to pursue PHP. During those, I haven't use any framework for PHP yet. Just old script embedding to HTML codes.

F﻿ast forward to 2016, I tried again reading about the C language from the start. Again, I was stuck at pointers. Still can't figure out even the fundamentals. So I decided that my brain cannot really cope with the language.

## What motivates me again

Y﻿ears have passed and I created real world problem solving softwares. One of these is by using VB.net. So it's a desktop software. I started building them on 2013 and took almost one (1) year to publish. I didn't publish it to a website or marketplace. I gave it up for free for use in a Government agency.

T﻿he next project I created was on 2016. When Google announced that Picasa Web will no longer be available. The reason for this is that we are using the service for uploading photos for reporting purposes. The photos uploaded there were geotagged photos and will be generated with google earth software for reporting purposes. So what I did is I wrote a PHP program that has the minimum capability of Picasa that can generate Google Earth file (KML). In this file, the URLs of the uploaded images are embedded. I sold it then and that was the first money I created using coding.

A﻿fter that, I decided to leave PHP and go with another language called Python. When I tried python syntax, oh man I thought at that time, I will never going back to C again. LOL. 

I﻿ was fascinated by the friendliness of the language and taught myself how to create web application using Python. And so I did and created my first SaaS using the Django framework. The year was 2019 but the SaaS part is not successful. I only had one client and sold it to them directly, running on their local machine. It is a billing helper for Business Permit application. it generates the amount to be paid at LGU (Local Government Unit) that will be used by their Engineering Department.

A﻿fter another year, I created my second app in Django and this time, I can say it was successful. It's still running today with growing clients.

H﻿owever, I can't stop thinking about the C language. This weekend, I'm thinking of developing more my understanding of computer programming and I think that the best way for me is to go close to the hardware. And what language that I know that is high level enough for the programmer but low level enough for the machine is C. And so I decided to give it another go. 

T﻿his weekend, I started reviewing C. With the help of ChatGPT, instead of buying or downloading a book, I instructed the AI chat model to make a syllabus for learning C. Not just one syllabus but of many. I instructed it to act as different people and create syllabus as those people would create if they were the ones to do it.
