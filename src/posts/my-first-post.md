## E﻿arly exposure to programming

M﻿y early days of being able to touch the C language is around 2006 on my 2nd year in college where we have a subject known as *Computer 1*. I remember only one program I have written in C at that time which is the conversion of an integer number to Roman Numerals. I remember, that was satisfying. That is my first program in any language and for the first time, the computer do what I intend it to do.

T﻿hese were the days when most used in this time of learning C was Turbo-C. This was the only IDE back then that was introduced to us. It was not even explained that it was called IDE. And that was the exposure I had with C in college, a one semester of one computer subject.



## Hindrance to C

T﻿he next language that was introduced to use was C++. And the experience were the same, not quite comprehensive and just basic stuff. Then fast forward to third year, somewhere in 2007, where the language visual basic 6.0 was introduced. Well that was obviously easier to comprehend with if you look at it right now. Because the controls you have to do are just drag and drop away. All you left to code is the logic of the program.
