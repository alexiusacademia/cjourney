## E﻿arly exposure to programming

M﻿y early days of being able to touch the C language is around 2006 on my 2nd year in college where we have a subject known as *Computer 1*. I remember only one program I have written in C at that time which is the conversion of an integer number to Roman Numerals. It was satisfying. That was my first program in any language and for the first time, the computer did what I intend it to do.

T﻿hese were the days when most used in this time of learning C was Turbo-C. This was the only IDE back then that was introduced to us. It was not even explained that it was called IDE. And that was the exposure I had with C in college, a one semester of one computer subject.

## Hindrance to C

T﻿he next language that was introduced to us was C++. And the experience were the same, not quite comprehensive and just basic stuff. Then fast forward to third year, somewhere in 2007, where the language visual basic 6.0 was introduced. Well that was obviously easier to comprehend with if you look at it right now. Because the controls you have to do are just drag and drop away. All you left to code is the logic of the program.

B﻿eing the only familiar language to me at the time, VB6 is what I used even on my thesis project where I wrote a software for structural analysis of various materials. That was not the last time I used VB6. I also used it more than a year later in a job to write material estimates software.

I﻿n 2010 to 2011, I tried web development with PHP. At this time, I haven't gotten much into a real world problem solving software but just the basics. I tried to create a social networking site but didn't got much traction. This was not the first time I tried web development, the first experience I had was back in college around 2007-2008 where wapsites (Wireless Application Protocol) are popular. I created a wapsite back then using the wapsite creator `wen.ru`.
