## E﻿arly exposure to the language

M﻿y early days of being able to touch the C language is around 2006 on my 2nd year in college where we have a subject known as *Computer 1*. I remember only one program I have written in C at that time which is the conversion of an integer number to Roman Numerals. I remember, that was satisfying. That is my first program in any language and for the first time, the computer do what I intend it to do.

T﻿hese were the days when most used in this time of learning C was Turbo-C. This was the only IDE back then that was introduced to us. It was not even explained that it was called IDE. And that was the exposure I had with C, a one semester of one computer subject.
