In this article, we will show a little about a SaaS that we a we are starting to build called <strong>FluentFlow</strong>.
It's a web app that we are planning to release as our next SaaS application.

## FluentFlow

Back in February 12, 2023, I started to plan and code a desktop application with the same name, `FluentFlow`. FluentFlow is a software for analyzing open channel flows such as in rivers and irrigation and drainage canals. At first, we planned that it will be a cross platform desktop application. 

## Challenges

It was primarily being developed in python with a mixture of C for performance in the core of the application. However, developing this size and features could take us an incredible amount of time and other resources. 

So I stepped back in the development and returned back to the drawing board. I have experience for both desktop and web development so I can say that I can fairly compare the two in terms of development and deployment. 

With all the parameters in mind and some comparisons with the stacks, we have concluded that the app will be continued to be developed for the web platform. Not only that the development tools and resources and easier to find, the deployment and customer reach will also improve. Both complexity and reachability to possible consumers.

So on April 2, 2023, the project has resumed, not back to zero but only in change in environment. `FluentFlow` will now be developed using web technologies and be deployed as a browser-based application. 

## Target Audience

The target users are professionals and students in the fields of civil, environmental, hydraulic and water resources engineering as well as researches and consultants in the related industries.

We envision a more affordable product that is way more less pain in the pocket than the existing ones and switching to web is a way to go. Since browsers today are distinguishably more highly performant than the previous decade, we can use this as advantage, delivering more affordable and modern products to the public.

This is all for this guys, thank you for reading and see you on the next one!
